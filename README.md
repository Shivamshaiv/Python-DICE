# Python-DICE
Python  3.6 implementation of  Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model (DICE), the model integrates in an end-to-end fashion the economics, carbon cycle, climate science, and impacts in a highly aggregated model that allows a weighing of the costs and benefits of taking steps to slow greenhouse warming. We support the interactive visulisation of the evolved parameters of the model with Plotly.js backend.
